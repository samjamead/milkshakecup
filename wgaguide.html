    <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Westcountry Golf Acadamy is Mid Devon's best kept secret. An immaculately kept nine-hole par-three course, the WGA is more challenging than it first appears. Water on nearly every hole keeps the mind focused from the tee, and slow but true greens require attention while putting. Don't be fooled by the fact that several holes have similar yardages; you'll certainly want a full bag of clubs.</p>

    <h3>Getting there</h3>
    <p>The course is a seven minute walk or a one minute drive from Tiverton Parkway railway station. Chuck this in Google Maps: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/WGA+Golf+Course/@50.9206602,-3.3633439,15z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x1a2ccb920f8f3382!2sWestcountry+Golf+Academy+Ltd!8m2!3d50.9206602!4d-3.3633439!3m4!1s0x486d94565081bed7:0xe0149895358e0375!8m2!3d50.9188997!4d-3.3663332" target="_blank">WGA Golf Course, EX16 7EH</a></p>

    <h3>Competition Interpretations of Local Rules</h3>
    <p>For some reason the course distinguishes between water hazards and lateral water hazards. We're going to simplify things and treat them the same.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Water Hazards</strong> &ndash; Take a drop from knee height within two club lengths, no nearer the hole, as close to the line of entry as possible. If the hazard was between you and the hole when you hit the ball in the water, your drop must leave the hazard between you and the green. The drop counts as one penalty stroke (so if you land in the water off the tee, the drop is your second shot, and you'll play your third from your dropped ball).</li>
      <li><strong>Out of Bounds Off the Tee</strong> &ndash; Take a drop from knee height within two club lengths, no nearer the hole, as close to where the ball went out of bounds as possible. One stroke penalty (so you'll play your third shot from where you drop a new ball).</li>
      <li><strong>Staked Trees</strong> &ndash; If your ball or stance come within two clublengths of a staked tree, you must take a free drop no nearer the hole at the nearest point of relief (i.e. the closest point that you can get two clublengths away from the staked tree, in any direction, as long as it is no nearer the hole).</li>
    </ul>
