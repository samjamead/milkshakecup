- hole: 1
  name: The Tarn
  description: A very nice looking hole, and a wonderful start to the competition. Water short, water right. Bunker protects the green on the left. Play for the front edge and enjoy an easy opening par!

- hole: 2
  name: Grand Oak
  description: Probably the same club that you took on the first hole, but this is slightly downhill, so plays a little shorter.

- hole: 3
  name: Foxes Drift
  description: The longest hole on the course, most can safely ignore the bunker on the right as it's a long way short of the green. Out of bounds left, out of bounds long.

- hole: 4
  name: Willows
  description: Played entirely over water, there's only about 6 feet of saftey short of the front of the green. Anything right is safe, but do shout fore if there's anyone on the 6th green!

- hole: 5
  name: Rabbit Copse
  description: A narrow hole, with a lateral water hazard all the way up the left, and bunkers protecting the green. Accuracy here is extremly important!

- hole: 6
  name: Lakeside
  description: The hardest hole on the course, the green is extremely well protected by a lake. It is possible to lay up down the left hand side, but make sure you carry the stream that feeds the lake.

- hole: 7
  name: The Burn
  description: A tricky three-tierd green is protected by a wee burn at the front of the geen. It's possible to putt into the water hazard...

- hole: 8
  name: Badgers Run
  description: The shortest and easiest hole on the course, just a flick with a wedge – or a nine iron at most. A dry lateral hazard awaits a thinned tee shot, so keep your head down and swing through the ball. Long is safe.

- hole: 9
  name: Tuberfield
  description: The finishing hole plays at least a club longer than its yardage. Anything right is wet, so play straight and low into the two-tierd green, and soak up the roars of the crowd as you walk up to the putting surface.
