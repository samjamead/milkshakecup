- hole: 1
  name: The Tarn
  description: A very nice looking hole, and a wonderful start to the competition. Water short, water right. Bunker protects the green on the left. Play for the front edge and enjoy an easy opening par!

- hole: 2
  name: Grand Oak
  description: Probably the same club that you took on the first hole, but this is slightly downhill, so plays a little shorter.
